# STUDENT-MANAGEMENT-PROJECT
#This is my first project
#i tried to write a simple School Management System  to help manage student and teacher information in schools.It is built using simple C programming techniques, it includes core features like adding, updating, viewing, and deleting records for students and teachers. It can track attendance, calculate percentages, check exam eligibility, calculate GPAs, and rank students. There’s also a search function for finding specific student or teacher details and a basic login system to control access. Since this is our first project, we kept it simple and focused on the most important functions, but there’s plenty of room for improvement. Future enhancements could include fee management for handling payments and reminders, staff management for tracking non-teaching staff details, course management to organize subjects and schedules, and exam result processing to automate grading and generate report cards. Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) would make the system more user-friendly and appealing, and features like class schedules and school hours management could improve organization. While this is just a starting point, these future ideas could turn it into a complete and powerful school management solution.
